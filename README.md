All datasets associated with this manuscript are provided in this repository. 

1) Firstly, the metadata associated with all samples - the management type, the site location, and the samples taken - are provided in "Fieldwork metadata.csv"
2) Fungal biodiversity profiles derived from all soil ("Run2" & "Run3") and root ("Run1") samples are provided in "fungal_dataset.csv"
3) Bacterial biodiversity profiles derived from all soil ("Run2" & "Run3") and root ("Run1") samples are provided in "bacterial_dataset.csv". Columns relating to OTU information and certain, unused taxonomic ranks have been removed due to file size.
4) Animal biodiversity profiles derived from all soil samples ("Run2" & "Run3") are provided in "animal_dataset.csv"
5) All coconut production datasets used are given in the files with name structure: "production_plotno._plantingyr..csv"
6) Information on production data required to align with the soil and root biodiversity samples are given in "Required trees.csv"
7) Information on dead trees without production data is given in "dead_trees.csv"
8) All of these datasets are required in the reproducible code for the creation and manipulation of associated datasets and figure production throughout this manuscript. This code is given in "Reproducible_code.R"
